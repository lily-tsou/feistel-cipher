# feistel-cipher
---
This feistel cipher was an assignment from Portland Statue University's CS 586: Cryptography. It is based on [Twofish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish) and [Skipjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipjack_(cipher)). 
The cipher uses at 64-bit block size and an 80-bit key. Because it is a feistel cipher, both encryption and decryption use the same algorithm, with the only difference being that decryption uses the keys in reverse order.
